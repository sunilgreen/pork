                                 A BILL


 
  To award a Congressional Gold Medal to Edward William Brooke III in 
  recognition of his unprecedented and enduring service to our Nation.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Edward William Brooke III 
Congressional Gold Medal Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    The Congress finds as follows:
            (1) Edward William Brooke III was the first African 
        American elected by popular vote to the United States Senate 
        and served with distinction for 2 terms from January 3, 1967, 
        to January 3, 1979.
            (2) In 1960, Senator Brooke began his public career when 
        Governor John Volpe appointed him chairman of the Boston 
        Finance Commission, where the young lawyer established an 
        outstanding record of confronting and eliminating graft and 
        corruption and proposed groundbreaking legislation for consumer 
        protection and against housing discrimination and air 
        pollution.
            (3) At a time when few African Americans held State or 
        Federal office, Senator Brooke became an exceptional pioneer, 
        beginning in 1962, when he made national and State history by 
        being elected Attorney General of Massachusetts, the first 
        African American in the Nation to serve as a State Attorney 
        General, the second highest office in the State, and the only 
        Republican to win statewide in the election that year, at a 
        time when there were fewer than 1,000 African American 
        officials in our Nation.
            (4) He won office as a Republican in a state that was 
        strongly Democratic.
            (5) As Massachusetts Attorney General, Senator Brooke 
        became known for his fearless and honest execution of the laws 
        of his State and for his vigorous prosecution of organized 
        crime.
            (6) The pioneering accomplishments of Edward William Brooke 
        III in public service were achieved although he was raised in 
        Washington, DC at a time when the Nation's capital was a city 
        where schools, public accommodations, and other institutions 
        were segregated, and when the District of Columbia did not have 
        its own self-governing institutions or elected officials.
            (7) Senator Brooke graduated from Paul Laurence Dunbar High 
        School and went on to graduate from Howard University in 1941.
            (8) Senator Brooke's enduring advocacy for self-government 
        and congressional voting rights for the citizens of Washington, 
        DC has roots in his life and personal experience as a native 
        Washingtonian.
            (9) Senator Brooke served for 5 years in the United States 
        Army in the segregated 366th Infantry Regiment during World War 
        II in the European theater of operations, attaining the rank of 
        captain and receiving a Bronze Star Medal for ``heroic or 
        meritorious achievement or service'' and the Distinguished 
        Service Award.
            (10) After the war, Senator Brooke attended Boston 
        University School of Law, where he served as editor of the 
        school's Law Review, graduating with an LL.B. in 1948 and an 
        LL.M. in 1949, and made Massachusetts his home.
            (11) During his career in Congress, Senator Brooke was a 
        leader on some of the most critical issues of his time, 
        including the war in Vietnam, the struggle for civil rights, 
        the shameful system of apartheid in South Africa, the Cold War, 
        and United States' relations with the People's Republic of 
        China.
            (12) President Lyndon B. Johnson appointed Senator Brooke 
        to the President's Commission on Civil Disorders in 1967, where 
        his work on discrimination in housing would serve as the basis 
        for the 1968 Civil Rights Act.
            (13) Senator Brooke continued to champion open housing when 
        he left the Senate and became the head of the National Low-
        Income Housing Coalition.
            (14) Senator Brooke has been recognized with many high 
        honors, among them the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2004, 
        an honor that recognizes ``an especially meritorious 
        contribution to the security or national interests of the 
        United States, world peace, cultural or other significant 
        public or private endeavors''; the Grand Cross of the Order of 
        Merit from the Government of Italy; a State courthouse 
        dedicated in his honor by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, 
        making him the first African American to have a State 
        courthouse named in his honor; the NAACP Spingarn Medal; and 
        the Charles Evans Hughes award from the National Conference of 
        Christians and Jews.
            (15) Senator Brooke's biography, Bridging The Divide: My 
        Life, was published in 2006, and he is the author of The 
        Challenge of Change: Crisis in Our Two-Party System, published 
        in 1966.
            (16) Senator Brooke became a racial pioneer, but race was 
        never at the center of his political campaigns.
            (17) He demonstrated to all that with commitment, 
        determination, and strength of character, even the barriers 
        once thought insurmountable can be overcome.
            (18) He has devoted his life to the service of others, and 
        made enormous contributions to our society today.
            (19) The life and accomplishments of Senator Brooke is 
        inspiring proof, as he says, that ``people can be elected on 
        the basis of their qualifications and not their race''.

_______________________________________________________________________

                                 A BILL


 
 To authorize appropriate action if the negotiations with the People's 
 Republic of China regarding China's undervalued currency and currency 
                    manipulation are not successful.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The currency of the People's Republic of China, the 
        yuan, is artificially pegged at a level significantly below its 
        market value. Economists estimate the yuan to be undervalued by 
        between 15 percent and 40 percent or an average of 27.5 
        percent.
            (2) The undervaluation of the yuan makes exports from the 
        People's Republic of China less expensive for foreign consumers 
        and makes foreign products more expensive for Chinese 
        consumers. The effective result is a significant subsidization 
        of China's exports and a virtual tariff on foreign imports, 
        leading the People's Republic of China to enjoy significant 
        trade surpluses with its international trading partners. The 
        United States trade deficit with China has widened from 
        $83,800,000,000 in 2000 to $213,548,600,000 in 2006, resulting 
        in an aggregate deficit with China of more than 
        $971,093,600,000 for that 7-year period.
            (3) China's undervalued currency and the United States 
        trade deficit with the People's Republic of China is 
        contributing to significant United States job losses and 
        harming United States businesses. In particular, the United 
        States manufacturing sector has lost more than 3,009,000 jobs 
        since January 2001.
            (4) The Government of the People's Republic of China has 
        intervened in the foreign exchange markets to hold the value of 
        the yuan within an artificial trading range. China's foreign 
        reserves are estimated to be more than $1,066,000,000,000 as of 
        January 1, 2007, and have increased at a level higher than that 
        of any other country.
            (5) China's undervalued currency and the Chinese 
        Government's intervention in the value of its currency violates 
        the spirit and letter of the world trading system of which the 
        People's Republic of China is now a member.
            (6) The Government of the People's Republic of China has 
        failed to promptly address concerns raised by the United States 
        and the international community regarding the value of its 
        currency.
            (7) Article XXI of the GATT 1994 (as defined in section 
        2(1)(B) of the Uruguay Round Agreements Act (19 U.S.C. 
        3501(1)(B)) allows a member of the World Trade Organization to 
        take any action which it considers necessary for the protection 
        of its essential security interests. Protecting the United 
        States manufacturing sector is essential to the security 
        interests of the United States.

SEC. 2. NEGOTIATIONS AND CERTIFICATION REGARDING THE CURRENCY VALUATION 
              POLICY OF THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA.

    (a) In General.--Notwithstanding the provisions of title I of 
Public Law 106-286 (19 U.S.C. 2431 note), on and after the date that is 
180 days after the date of enactment of this Act, unless a 
certification described in subsection (b) has been made to Congress, 
there shall be imposed a rate of duty of 27.5 percent ad valorem on any 
article that is the growth, product, or manufacture of the People's 
Republic of China and is imported directly or indirectly into the 
United States, in addition to any other duty that would otherwise apply 
to such article.
    (b) Certification.--The certification referred to in subsection (a) 
is a certification by the President to Congress that the People's 
Republic of China is no longer manipulating the rate of exchange 
between its currency and the United States dollar for purposes of 
preventing an effective balance of payments and gaining an unfair 
competitive advantage in international trade. The certification shall 
also include a determination that the currency of the People's Republic 
of China is valued in accordance with accepted market-based trading 
policies.
    (c) Negotiations.--Beginning on the date of enactment of this Act, 
the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the United States 
Trade Representative, shall begin negotiations with the People's 
Republic of China to ensure that the People's Republic of China adopts 
a process that leads to a market-based system of currency valuation.

To authorize the Attorney General to make grants to improve the ability 
of State and local governments to prevent the abduction of children by 
                family members, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Family Abduction Prevention Act of 
2007''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds that--
            (1) each year more than 203,000 children in the United 
        States (approximately 78 percent of all abducted children) are 
        abducted by a family member, usually a parent;
            (2) more than half of the parents who abduct their children 
        have a history of alcohol or substance abuse, a criminal 
        record, or a history of violence;
            (3) the most common motive for family abduction is revenge 
        against the other parent, not protecting the child's safety;
            (4) children who are abducted by family members suffer 
        emotional, psychological, and often physical abuse at the hands 
        of their abductors;
            (5) children who are victims of family abductions are 
        forced to leave behind family, friends, their homes, their 
        neighborhoods, their schools, and all that is familiar to them;
            (6) children who are victims of family abductions are often 
        told that the parent who did not abduct the child has died, 
        does not love them, or will harm them;
            (7) children who are abducted by their parents or other 
        family members are sometimes forced to live in fear of 
        discovery and may be compelled to conceal their true identity, 
        including their real names, family histories, and even their 
        gender;
            (8) children who are victims of family abductions are often 
        denied the opportunity to attend school or to receive health 
        and dental care;
            (9) child psychologists and law enforcement authorities now 
        classify family abduction as a form of child abuse;
            (10) approximately 70 percent of local law enforcement 
        agencies do not have written guidelines for what to do in the 
        event of a family abduction or how to facilitate the recovery 
        of an abducted child;
            (11) the first few hours of a family abduction are crucial 
        to recovering an abducted child, and valuable hours are lost 
        when law enforcement is not prepared to employ the most 
        effective techniques to locate and recover abducted children;
            (12) when parents who may be inclined to abduct their own 
        children receive counseling and education on the harm suffered 
        by children under these circumstances, the incidence of family 
        abductions is greatly reduced; and
            (13) where practiced, the flagging of school records has 
        proven to be an effective tool in assisting law enforcement 
        authorities find abducted children.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. FINDINGS.

    The Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) Vicente Beltran Luna, at the age of 25, came to the 
        United States from San Miguel Allende, Mexico, and began work 
        for a dairy in Floresville, Texas, in August 1998.
            (2) Vicente Beltran Luna and five other individuals lived 
        in a shed at the dairy that formerly housed chickens and dogs.
            (3) On March 16, 2000, as Vicente Beltran Luna was removing 
        his belongings from the shed, where living conditions were 
        deplorable, an explosion and fire erupted from methane fumes 
        that leaked from a septic tank pipe.
            (4) Vicente Beltran Luna suffered third-degree burns over 
        fifty-five percent of his body, which has required numerous 
        painful surgeries, skin grafts, corrective eyelid surgery, and 
        the amputation of all but three fingers.
            (5) Vicente Beltran Luna still needs to receive extensive 
        surgeries and rehabilitation.
            (6) In a legal settlement with the dairy, Vicente Beltran 
        Luna was awarded sufficient funds to ensure his financial 
        solvency for the remainder of his life.
            (7) Granting Vicente Beltran Luna permanent legal residency 
        in the United States would allow him to receive the follow-up 
        medical attention that he continues to need, without imposing 
        any financial burden on the taxpayer.

the alien's birth under section 203(a) of the Immigration and 
Nationality Act or, if applicable, the total number of immigrant visas 
that are made available to natives of the country of the alien's birth 
under section 202(e) of such Act.
    (e) Denial of Preferential Immigration Treatment for Certain

 Mr. Young of Alaska introduced the following bill; which was referred 
                 to the Committee on Natural Resources

_______________________________________________________________________

                                 A BILL


 
 To amend the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 to repeal the long-
  term goal for reducing to zero the incidental mortality and serious 
   injury of marine mammals in commercial fishing operations, and to 
   modify the goal of take reduction plans for reducing such takings.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. FINDINGS.

    The Congress finds the following:
            (1) The goal of the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 
        (16 U.S.C. 1361 et seq.) is to maintain marine mammal species 
        and population stocks at their optimum sustainable populations.
            (2) If the annual removals of individuals of a species or 
        population stock of marine mammals do not exceed the potential 
        biological removal level, the species or population stock will 
        be maintained at, or reach, its optimum sustainable population.
            (3) Requiring that commercial fishermen achieve a zero 
        mortality rate goal for a species or population stock of marine 
        mammals that is equal to or less than 10 percent of the 
        potential biological removal of a given marine mammal species 
        or population stock is unnecessary to achieve that Act's goal 
        of maintaining species and stocks at their optimum sustainable 
        population and penalizes commercial fishermen.
            (4) The Congress intended that the zero mortality rate goal 
        under that Act would be met if fishermen use the best 
        technology that is economically and technologically feasible.
            (5) Species and populations stocks of marine mammal that 
        have reached historic levels are impeding the recovery of 
        endangered species and threatened species through predation or 
        competition in the ecosystem.
            (6) The fundamental principles of ecosystem management are 
        defeated by giving one species a preeminent position in the 
        ecosystem through, imposition of a zero mortality rate goal.
            (7) All persons that interact with marine mammals should 
        seek to reduce and eliminate marine mammal injuries and 
        mortalities through the use of the best equipment and 
        techniques that are economically and technologically feasible.

SEC. 2. MODIFICATION OF GOALS FOR REDUCING INCIDENTAL TAKE OF MARINE 
              MAMMALS IN COMMERCIAL FISHING.

                    IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES

                           February 13, 2007

 Mr. Capuano introduced the following bill; which was referred to the 
                    Committee on Energy and Commerce

_______________________________________________________________________

                                 A BILL


 
To require automobile dealers to disclose to consumers the presence of 
 event data recorders, or ``black boxes'', on new automobiles, and to 
require manufacturers to provide the consumer with the option to enable 
            and disable such devices on future automobiles.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) From the standpoint of consumer privacy rights, most 
        consumers are not aware that their vehicles are recording data 
        that not only may be used to aid traffic safety analyses, but 
        has the potential of being used against them in a civil or 
        criminal proceeding, or by their insurer to increase rates.
            (2) There exists no Federal law clarifying the rights of a 
        vehicle owner to ownership of the recorded data and, in the 
        absence of Federal direction, States have begun to create 
        different standards of ownership and rights for recorded data.

SEC. 2. OWNERSHIP AND RETRIEVAL OF EVENT DATA RECORDER DATA.

    Any event data recorder in a vehicle and any data recorded on any 
event data recorder in a vehicle shall be considered the property of 
the owner of the vehicle. It shall be unlawful for any person other 
than the owner of the motor vehicle to download or otherwise retrieve 
data that is recorded on any event data recorder except under one of 
the following circumstances:
            (1) The owner of the motor vehicle or the owner's agent or 
        legal representative consents to the retrieval of the 
        information.
            (2) In response to an order of a court having jurisdiction 
        to issue the order.
            (3) The data is retrieved by a motor vehicle dealer, or by 
        an automotive technician for the purpose of diagnosing, 
        servicing, or repairing the motor vehicle.
            (4) For the purpose of improving motor vehicle safety, 
        including medical research on the human body's reaction to 
        motor vehicle accidents, provided that the identity of the 
        registered owner or driver is not disclosed in connection with 
        that retrieved data.

SEC. 3. REQUIREMENT FOR EVENT DATA RECORDERS ON NEW AUTOMOBILES.

    It shall be unlawful for any person to manufacture for sale, sell, 
offer for sale, introduce, or deliver into interstate commerce, or 
import into the United States, a new automobile manufactured after 2009 
(and bearing a model year of 2010 or later) that is equipped with an 
event data recorder, unless such event data recorder includes a 
function whereby the consumer has the option to enable or disable the 
recording function of the event data recorder. Once disabled, the 
recording function shall not resume functioning until the consumer 
elects to enable such functioning.

SEC. 4. ENFORCEMENT.

    (a) Treatment of Violations as Unfair or Deceptive Acts or 
Practices.--A violation of section 2 or 3 shall be treated as a 
violation of a rule defining an unfair or deceptive act or practice 
prescribed under section 18(a)(1)(B) of the Federal Trade Commission 
Act (15 U.S.C. 57a(a)(1)(B)).
    (b) Federal Trade Commission Authority.--The Federal Trade 
Commission shall enforce this Act in the same manner, by the same 
means, and with the same jurisdiction, powers, and duties as though all 
applicable terms and provisions of the Federal Trade Commission Act (15 
U.S.C. 41 et seq.) were incorporated into and made a part of this Act.

SEC. 5. DEFINITIONS.

    As used in this Act:
            (1) The term ``consumer'' has the meaning given the term 
        ``ultimate purchaser'' in section 2 of the Automobile 
        Information Disclosure Act (15 U.S.C. 1231).
            (2) The term ``dealer'' has the meaning given that term in 
        section 30102(a) of title 49, United States Code.
            (3) The term ``event data recorder'' means any device or 
        means of technology installed in an automobile that records 
        information such as vehicle speed, seatbelt use, application of 
        brakes or other information pertinent to the operation of the 
        automobile.
            (4) The terms ``manufacturer'' and ``new automobile'' have 
        the meanings given those terms in section 2 of the Automobile 
        Information Disclosure Act (15 U.S.C. 1231).

SEC. 6. EFFECTIVE DATE.

    This Act shall take effect 180 days after the date of enactment of

                Authorization Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-201), in 
                recognizing that certain large urban areas remain high 
                threat targets and are inadequately prepared to respond 
                to a weapon of mass destruction event;
                    (B) addresses the unique equipment, training, 
                planning and exercise needs of selected large high 
                threat urban areas; and
                    (C) has become known as the Urban Area Security 
                Initiative.
            (2) The allocation of the funds available for fiscal year 
        2006 for the Urban Areas Security Initiative grants program of 
        the Department of Homeland Security did not reflect the 
        original intent of the program.
            (3) The needs-based variable used in the funding formula 
        for such allocation is not a proper risk-based variable.
            (4) The allocation of funds for such program should be 
        based solely on the risk of terrorist attack, and determined 
        based solely on consideration of threat of, vulnerabilities to, 
        and consequence of such an attack.

                                 AN ACT


 
To direct the Secretary of the Interior to conduct a special resources 
study regarding the suitability and feasibility of designating certain 
 historic buildings and areas in Taunton, Massachusetts, as a unit of 
           the National Park System, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Taunton, Massachusetts Special 
Resources Study Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) The city of Taunton, Massachusetts, is home to 9 
        distinct historic districts, with more than 600 properties on 
        the National Register of Historic Places. Included among these 
        districts are the Church Green Historic District, the 
        Courthouse Historic District, the Taunton Green Historic 
        District, and the Reed and Barton Historic District.
            (2) All of these districts include buildings and building 
        facades of great historical, cultural, and architectural value.
            (3) Taunton Green is the site where the Sons of Liberty 
        first raised the Liberty and Union Flag in 1774, an event that 
        helped to spark a popular movement, culminating in the American 
        Revolution, and Taunton citizens have been among the first to 
        volunteer for America's subsequent wars.
            (4) Robert Treat Paine, a citizen of Taunton, and the first 
        Attorney General of Massachusetts, was a signer of the 
        Declaration of Independence.
            (5) Taunton was a leading community in the Industrial 
        Revolution, and its industrial area has been the site of many 
        innovations in such industries as silver manufacture, paper 
        manufacture, and ship building.
            (6) The landscaping of the Courthouse Green was designed by 
        Frederick Law Olmsted, who also left landscaping ideas and 
        plans for other areas in the city which have great value and 
        interest as historical archives and objects of future study.
            (7) Main Street, which connects many of the historic 
        districts, is home to the Taunton City Hall and the Leonard 
        Block building, 2 outstanding examples of early 19th Century 
        American architecture, as well as many other historically and 
        architecturally significant structures.
            (8) The city and people of Taunton have preserved many 
        artifacts, gravesites, and important documents dating back to 
        1638 when Taunton was founded.
            (9) Taunton was and continues to be an important 
        destination for immigrants from Europe and other parts of the 
        world who have helped to give Southeastern Massachusetts its 
        unique ethnic character.

SEC. 3. STUDY.

    The Secretary, in consultation with the appropriate State historic 
preservation officers, State historical societies, the city of Taunton, 
and other appropriate organizations, shall conduct a special resources 
study regarding the suitability and feasibility of designating certain 
historic buildings and areas in Taunton, Massachusetts, as a unit of 
the National Park System. The study shall be conducted and completed in 
accordance with section 8(c) of Public Law 91-383 (16 U.S.C. 1a-5(c)) 
and shall include analysis, documentation, and determinations regarding 
whether the historic areas in Taunton--
            (1) can be managed, curated, interpreted, restored, 
        preserved, and presented as an organic whole under management 
        by the National Park Service or under an alternative management 
        structure;
            (2) have an assemblage of natural, historic, and cultural 
        resources that together represent distinctive aspects of 
        American heritage worthy of recognition, conservation, 
        interpretation, and continuing use;
            (3) reflect traditions, customs, beliefs, and historical 
        events that are valuable parts of the national story;
            (4) provide outstanding opportunities to conserve natural, 
        historic, cultural, architectural, or scenic features;
            (5) provide outstanding recreational and educational 
        opportunities; and
            (6) can be managed by the National Park Service in 
        partnership with residents, business interests, nonprofit 
        organizations, and State and local governments to develop a 
        unit of the National Park System consistent with State and 
        local economic activity.

SEC. 4. REPORT.

    Not later than 3 fiscal years after the date on which funds are 
first made available for this Act, the Secretary shall submit to the 
Committee on Natural Resources of the House of Representatives and the 
Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of the Senate a report on the 
findings, conclusions, and recommendations of the study required under 
section 3.

SEC. 5. PRIVATE PROPERTY.

    The recommendations in the report submitted pursuant to section 4 
shall include discussion and consideration of the concerns expressed by 
private landowners with respect to designating certain structures 
referred to in this Act as a unit of the National Park System.
